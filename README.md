Within are the rules for the yearly Ocarina of Time {OoT} Race that Anthony, Chris, George, and Nick participate in.

N.B. It's recommended to open this project within [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md); Github's flavour of [markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm) is shit for relative links (it'll show them as `[[README#$link here]]` rather than the link to the correct section/line.

# 1. Basic Rules
1.  All participants _must_ livestream their gameplay **to Youtube**.
2. All participants _must_ be playing on the same versions of Ship of Harkinian {SoH}.
	1. This will be agreed upon for each individual race until SoH has a version that's in a stable state with all QoL features that work for us.
3. All participants _must_ be playing with the same type (vanilla or rando) and version of the OoT ROM.
	1. This will be agreed upon for each individual race until we determine a specific ROM works for us and is stable enough to not cause issues during the race.
	2. If a rando ROM is chosen for that year's race, items _must_ be acquired in the order they're allowed to appear in the vanilla game. See [[README#^679b7b|ยง2.1.1.0.]] for an example.
4. All players _must_ have the same settings that affect gameplay set on their SoH. If an export of settings is possible, it's probably worth doing so and sharing that settings file so everyone has the same settings.
	1. Cosmetic settings _are_ allowed to be changed.
	2. Overlays (for instance with an input tracker) _are_ allowed.
5. Players may create and select their save file ahead of the race commencing, but are not allowed to open the save file until the verbal countdown "3,2,1,Go" has finished. This is to ensure all players start the race at the same time.
6. To complete the game, players must complete the main story (up to and including defeating Ganon), as well as a number of tasks outlined in [[README#2. Additional Tasks to be Completed|ยง2.]].
7. The race concludes for a player once the cutscene where Link kills Ganon begins playing, or once they complete their last task; whichever comes last after both the main story and the additional tasks have been completed.
8. The completion of the game, as well as the specified tasks that players must complete, _must_ be done "in-logic". For example, players must get the Lens of Truth {LoT} before crossing the desert; even if they're able to run the desert route without using the LoT.

# 2. Additional Tasks to be Completed
1. There are a number of additional items that _must_ be acquired before a run can be considered complete, in additional to the basic items required to complete the game within logic.
	1. The Three Great Fairy Magics
			When using a rando ROM, players _must not_ acquire any of these before acquiring the magic meter ^679b7b
		1. Din's Fire
		2. Farore's Wind
		3. Nayru's Love
	3. The Three Elemental Arrows
		1. Fire Arrows
		2. Ice Arrows
		3. Light Arrows
	4. Biggoron's Sword
	5. The Mask of Truth
2. There are also a number of additional side quests that _must_ be completed before a run can be considered complete.
	1. Obtaining Epona
		1. When using a rando ROM, players _must_ jump the fences on Epona before speaking to Ingo to begin the race.
	2. Biggoron's Sword Quest
		1. When using a rando ROM, players _must_ complete time-sensitive portions of this quest within the time limits that would normally be set. These are:
			1. Taking the Odd Mushroom to the Potion Seller
			2. Taking the Eyeball Frog to the Lake Hylia Scientist
			3. Taking the Eyedrops to Biggoron
		2. Similarly, players are _not_ allowed to warp for those portions of the quest, as this would normally fail that section of the quest.
	3. Happy Mask Shop
		1. Players _are_ allowed to use the grotto skip to hand off the Bunny Hood quicker. (see [[README#^36d688|ยง3.1.2.2.]])

# 3. Gentlemen's Agreements
1. Techniques or glitches that require specialist knowledge or setup to execute consistently are banned.
	1. Examples of this include:
		1. [Deku Tree B1 skip](https://youtu.be/rxHc-r2Mqao)
		3. [Water Temple jump to WL3](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MURb8QeVXt0)
	2. Adjacent examples that _are_ allowed include:
		1. Crouch stabbing
			1. This requires no specialist knowledge and/or set up to execute consistently.
		2. Grotto skipping to hand off the Bunny Hood quicker. ^36d688
			1. This requires no specialist knowledge and/or set up to execute consistently.
2. Techniques or glitches that leave the gameplay unrecognisable from the spirit of the game are banned.
	0. Examples of this include:
		1. Infinite Sword Glitching (ISG)
		2. Wrong Warping
		3. Exploiting vulnerabilities to lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
		4. Rolling into a chest surrounded by fire in order to open it during iframes
3. Certain settings have been GA'd to be allowed:
	1. King Zora will move at 5x speed.
	2. Items can be assigned to the dpad
	3. The Ocarina can be played using the dpad

# 4. Voting
1. The players have voted on a number of rules, with certain players voicing objections to the consensus. These objections are noted below if applicable:
	1. Players are _not_ allowed to jumpslash the silver rupee through ice to capture it quicker.
		1. This was later expanded to "No clipping glitches whatsoever".
		2. George objected to the results of the initial vote. Unclear if he objects to clipping glitches being banned.
	3. Players will push blocks at 1x speed.
	4. Players will climb at 1x speed.
	5. Players will crawl at 1x speed.
		1. Chris objected, he voted to crawl at 2x speed.
	6. Players are not allowed to unequip equipment.
		1. For example, the Kokiri Shield can not be unequipped so that Link has no shield, but it _can_ be replaced with the Hylian Shield.
	7. Players will play without the setting to allow all items (such as Shields and Tunics) from being assignable.
		1. George objected.
